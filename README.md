# example of using an LLM
- extremely simple
- uses VSH component for MVI (minimum viable implementation)
- needs to be improved for production
- note: to run this, you must set the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY to your openai key (put a few $s into your account and generate a key, or, rewrite the command in the main component to use some other LLM)
- this version based on Emil Valeev's project "Agency"  (written in Go)
